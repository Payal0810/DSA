You are given a ‘Binary Tree’.

Return the preorder traversal of the Binary Tree.

Sample Input 1:
1 2 3 5 4 6 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1


 Sample Output 1:
1 2 5 4 3 6 7


Sample Input 2:
5 6 10 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 9 -1 -1


Sample Output 2:
5 6 2 3 9 10

Expected Time Complexity:
Try to do this in O(n).


Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100000
where 'n' is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

Time Limit: 1 sec
